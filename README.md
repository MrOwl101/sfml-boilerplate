# sfml-boilerplate
This repo contains few basic things for starting a SFML project. I made it so i don't have to remember a way of compiling

# how to use this repo
1. download or clone this repo
2. check if make is installed, you can try to call *make app* command from the makefile, it will generate an app from **main.cpp**
3. change the **main.cpp** and add what you want to it
4. end of tutorial, git gud

# commands for make
- *make app* -> creates executable file **sfml-app** from **main.cpp**
- *make clean* -> cleans **main.o** and **sfml-app**
